# Cooking and Meals

Meals are an essential part of camping. Tips for efficient and enjoyable cooking:

- Reduce reliance on BBQ; consider alternatives like gas stoves or Dutch ovens.
- Pre-cut ingredients the day before to save time.
- Plan meals that suit the season and activities, such as curry in winter or light meals in summer.
