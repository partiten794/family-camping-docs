# Gear Management

Organize your gear based on importance and purpose:

- Tier 1: Essential gear like tents, sleeping bags, and lanterns.
- Tier 2: Useful but replaceable items like BBQ grills or cooking utensils.
- Tier 3: Optional items that enhance the experience, such as coffee kits or binoculars.
