# Purpose and Philosophy

Camping is not just an activity; it's an opportunity to connect with nature, relax, and create lasting memories. Here are some key points to consider:

- Define the purpose of each camping trip (e.g., relaxation, activities, specific meals).
- Avoid preconceived notions about camping. Embrace the joy of being in nature, enjoying local food, and immersing yourself in the environment.
- Make camping a primary travel option by standardizing and preparing for various scenarios.
